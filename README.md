# Artifcat Enhancements for CS499

This repository contains the enhancements made to the following artifacts for the ePortfolio for CS499: Computer Science Capstone at Southern New Hampshire University:

•	Control Your Inventory: Mobile Application

•	Empowering Academic Advisors

•	Rescue Rover Dashboard

These three artifacts showcased skills I learned throughout the Computer Science program, such as software development and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases. While each of the artifacts showcases multiple skills, they each have a specific skill in mind when developing them. The Control You Inventory mobile app focused on software development and design, the Empowering Academic Advisors program focused on data structures and algorithms, and the Rescue Rover Dashboard focused on databases.

# Control Your Inventory

I continuously sought to enhance the Control Your Inventory application's functionality and user experience while developing it. The idea was to create an application that was minimal and intuitive for the user but still provided a robust experience for the users. Initially, the application offered basic inventory management features, such as adding and removing items. However, based on feedback from code reviews and reviewing other inventory tracking system applications, there have been numerous areas where improvement has been seen. For instance, the user can automate an SMS alert when an item stock level reaches a certain level and integration with barcode scanning devices. These enhancements made the application more robust and user-friendly.

I learned valuable lessons while creating and improving the project and faced several challenges. I developed a deeper understanding of the importance of gathering and documenting functional requirements, design documentation, and business requirements at the start of a project. These documents played a critical role in guiding the development process, ensuring that the application met the needs of its users. Creating these documents required careful consideration of user workflows, system constraints, and scalability requirements. Additionally, I learned the importance of incorporating user feedback and conducting code reviews to ensure the program meets the set requirements.

Developing and enhancing the Control Your Inventory application has allowed me to apply my computer science skills in the real world. It has strengthened my software development, database management, and user interface design abilities, making it a valuable addition to my ePortfolio.

# Empowering Academic Advisors

To enhance the artifact, I implemented several significant improvements to the codebase. The major enhancement focused on modularization, where I divided the code into smaller, more manageable functions. This reorganization significantly improved the code's readability, maintainability, and overall structure. In addition, I addressed the presence of magic numbers by replacing them with named constants, resulting in more understandable and maintainable code. Another area of improvement was error handling. I introduced exception handling to manage errors during file operations and CSV parsing. This enhancement improved error reporting and ensured the application could handle various CSV file formats correctly.

Furthermore, I enhanced memory management by utilizing exception-handling techniques to guarantee proper file closure and prevent resource leaks. Finally, emphasizing the importance of documentation, I added comprehensive comments to elucidate the purpose and functionality of various functions. These comments explain complex operations and algorithms, serving as a valuable reference for future development and facilitating collaboration with other developers.

By implementing these enhancements, I successfully achieved the course objectives I had set for this module. The artifact's modularization, error handling, improved CSV parsing, error reporting, memory management, and documentation components align with these objectives. Notably, these enhancements underscore my understanding and application of software development best practices and my ability to create robust and maintainable code.

Throughout the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact, I have gained valuable insights and experiences. For example, I have come to appreciate the importance of modularization in improving code readability and maintainability. One of the challenges I faced was identifying areas for improvement and making informed decisions about the best approaches to address them. Additionally, I encountered the task of seamlessly integrating new functionalities with existing code. However, I persevered and developed effective strategies to overcome these challenges. I also recognized the significance of error handling and proper reporting during this process. These aspects enhance the user experience and simplify the debugging and troubleshooting process. Moreover, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of thorough documentation, as it promotes code comprehension and encourages collaboration among developers.

Overall, enhancing and modifying the artifact has been an invaluable learning experience. It has reinforced my software development skills and expanded my understanding of best practices in the field. Through this process, I have acquired the ability to deliver high-quality code and further honed my software developer skills.



# Rescue Rover Dashboard

There were numerous improvements made to the artifact's codebase. The upgrades started with fixing standard naming conventions, any typos that could be found throughout the codebase, and any syntax errors. The additional enhancements to the codebase were separating data access logic, code organization, separate configuration, error handling, logging, use of environment variables, input validation, documentation, and performance optimization.

I learned the importance of code organization, modularization, and following best practices in software development. I gained experience in incorporating error handling and logging mechanisms to improve the robustness and maintainability of the code. I also faced challenges ensuring consistency and adhering to naming conventions while making the code more modular. However, the challenges were overcome through iterative improvements and careful consideration, resulting in a more polished and professional artifact.
